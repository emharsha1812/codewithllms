title: My Journey with Language Models
---

Hey there, fellow explorers of the language universe! 👋 I'm thrilled to have you on this journey with me as I navigate the exciting realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). 🌐✨

This space is my digital diary, a chronicle of the highs and lows, the "aha" moments, and the code-driven adventures as I delve into the heart of language processing. Whether you're a fellow enthusiast, a curious learner, or just stumbled upon this corner of the web, I'm delighted to have you here.

Expect a mix of coding snippets, reflections on challenges faced, and the occasional burst of excitement when a complex concept finally clicks. 🤓💻

Feel free to explore, learn, and share your insights. Let's embark on this learning odyssey together!

NOTE - As of February 11th 2024, a lot has happened in the field of Generative AI which is now becoming too overwhelming for me. Hence for now, I would focus on completing the Educative courses which can get me upto speed with Generative AI and everything else going on with Large Language Models. Also I would keep a list of research papers that would be continuously updated
